#coding
- go is my preferred "quick" language, for slower stuff, i use [python](notes/coding/python.md)


### some cool frameworks
- [discordgo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo)
	- pretty good discord library for go, but i like discord.py or naff a little more because theyre a lot more high level (eg include a command framework and stuff)
- [go-chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi)
	- simple abstraction over net/http, with custom slugs (`/<custom param>`)
	- i built [url](https://suhas.one/r/url) in this
- [fiber](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber)
	- more complex http router, very fun to use
	- inspired by express i think
